### Answers to exercises - Shell scripting

1. Write a shell script that allows a user to enter his or her top three ice cream flavors. Your script should then print out the name of all three flavors.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
read -p "Enter your three ice cream flavors : " ice1 ice2 ice3
echo "Thanks $USER!"
echo "1# ${ice1}"
echo "2# ${ice2}"
echo "3# ${ice3}"
```  

2. Write a shell script that allows a user to enter any existing file name. The program should then copy file to /tmp directory. An advanced solution would check whether the file exists.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Version 1 (blind copy)
read -p "Enter any file name : " filename
cp $filename /tmp
```  
  OR  
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Version 2 (first check for $filename and than copy it, else display an error message)
read -p "Enter any file name : " filename

# if file exists, than copy it
if [ -f "${filename}" ]
then
	cp -v "$filename" /tmp
else
	echo "$0: $filename not found."
fi
```  

3. Write a simple shell script where the user enters a pizza parlor bill total. Your script should then display a 10 percent tip.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
clear
echo "*************************"
echo "*** Joes Pizza Parlor ***"
echo "*************************"
echo
echo "Today is $(date)"
echo
read -p "Enter a pizza parlor bill : " bill

tip=$(echo "scale=2; (${bill}*10) / 100" | bc -l)
total=$(echo "scale=2; $tip + $bill" | bc -l)
echo "Pizza bill : $bill"
echo "Tip (10%)  : ${tip}"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "Total      : ${total}"
echo "--------------------------"
```  

4. Write a simple calculator program that allows user to enter two numeric values and operand. The program should then print out the result of the operation on the two numbers. Make sure it works according to entered operand.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
read -p "Enter two values : " a b
read -p "Enter operand ( +, -, /, *) : " op
ans=$(( $a $op $b ))
echo "$a $op $b = $ans"
```  

5. Write a shell script that, given a file name as the argument will count blank spaces, characters, number of line and symbols. The advanced version would also count the number of vowels.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
file=$1
v=0

if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
	echo "$0 fileName"
	exit 1
fi
if [ ! -f $file ]
then
	echo "$file not a file"
	exit 2
fi

#advanced starts
while read -n 1 c
do
  l=$(echo $c | tr [:upper:] [:lower:])
  [[ "$l" == "a" || "$l" == "e" || "$l" == "i" || "$l" == "o" || "$l" == "u" ]] && (( v++ ))
done < $file

echo "Vowels : $v"
#advanced ends
echo "Characters : $(cat $file | wc -c)"
echo "Blank lines : $(grep  -c '^$' $file)"
echo "Lines : $(cat $file | wc -l)"
```  

6. Write a shell script that, given a file name as the argument will write the even numbered line to a file with name `evenfile` and odd numbered lines in a text file called `oddfile`.
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh
file=$1
counter=0

if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
	echo "$0 fileName"
	exit 1
fi
if [ ! -f $file ]
then
	echo "$file not a file"
	exit 2
fi

while read line
do
	((counter++))
	EvenNo=$(( counter%2 ))

	if [ $EvenNo -eq 0 ]
	then
		echo $line >> evenfile
	else
		echo $line >> oddfile
	fi

done < $file
```  

7. Write a shell program to read a number (such as 123) and find the sum of digits (1+2+3=6).
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh

#store the no
num=$1

#store the value of sum
sum=0

if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
	echo "$0 number"
	exit 1
fi

while [ $num -gt 0 ]
do
	digit=$(( num%10 ))
	num=$(( num/10 ))
	sum=$(( digit+sum ))
done

echo "Sum of digits = $sum"
```  

8. Write a shell program to read two numbers and display all the odd numbers between those two numbers.
  ```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Shell program to read two numbers and display all the odd

echo -n "Enter first number : "
read n1

echo -n "Enter second number : "
read n2

if [ $n2 -gt $n1 ];
then
  for(( i=$n1; i<=$n2; i++ ))
  do
    # see if it is odd or even number
    test=$(( $i % 2 ))
    if [ $test -ne 0 ];
    then
      echo $i
    fi
  done
else
  echo "$n2 must be greater than $n1, try again..."
fi
```

### Answers to exercises - awk

1. How many genes are there in the [`reference genome`](exercises/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.83.gtf.gz)? Don't forget to unpack the file.
2. How many transcripts does your favourite gene have, e.g. ENSG00000001461?
3. How many exons?
4. Which exon is the longest?
5. Make a file of the transcriptIDs annotated by Havana.
6. Print odd lines.
7. Produce a tab separated file with these columns: transcriptID, exon_number, exon_length.

```bash
#1
cut -f3  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | grep -c gene
cut -f3  Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | sort | uniq -c #alternative
#2
awk '$10 ~/ENSG00000001461/ && $3 ~/trans/' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | wc -l
#3
awk '$10 ~/ENSG00000001461/ && $3 ~/exon/' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | wc -l
#4
awk '$10 ~/ENSG00000001461/ && $3 ~/exon/ {gsub(/"|;/, "", $10); printf("%s\t%d\n", $10, ($5-$4))}' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | sort -rnk2 | head -1
#5
awk '$2 ~/^havana$/ && $3 ~/transcript/ {gsub(/"|;/, "", $10); print $14}' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf > havana_transcripts.txt
#6
awk 'NR %2 ==0' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf | head
#7
awk '$1 !~ /^#/ && $3 ~/exon/ {gsub(/"|;/, "", $14); gsub(/"|;/, "", $18); printf("%s\t%d\t%d\n", $14, $18, ($5-$4))}' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.82.gtf > exon_length.txt
```
